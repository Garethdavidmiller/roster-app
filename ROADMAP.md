# MYB Roster — Product Roadmap

*Last updated: May 2026 — v8.40*

This file covers what's been built, what could come next, and design experiments that were tried and reverted. For implementation specs (Firestore schema, Cloud Function APIs, Firebase Auth migration, etc.), see CLAUDE.md.

---

## Completed phases

### Phase 1 — Firestore read layer ✓
Owner manually enters shift overrides. App reads and overlays them on the base roster. No user logins required.

### Phase 2 — Staff self-service portal ✓
Individual staff log in and enter their own overrides. Admin (G. Miller) has elevated access.

**What was built:**
- admin.html — self-service portal for all staff plus admin tools
- Individual login per staff member (name + surname password)
- AL booking with entitlement tracking (32 days CEA, 34 days CES/Dispatcher/Fixed)
- Bulk override operations and override history
- Cultural calendar marker preference per member (Islamic, Hindu, Chinese, Jamaican, Congolese, Portuguese)
- Dispatcher and fixed roster types
- Firestore security rules — server-side validation of all writes

**Auth note:** The original plan specified Firebase Auth (Microsoft SSO or email/password). The implementation uses a simpler surname-based password with localStorage sessions. This was a deliberate divergence — no Chiltern IT dependency, no registration flow, works immediately for all staff. Firebase Auth is now partially wired in (v7.61) for future hardening; see CLAUDE.md → "Firebase Auth migration".

## Built since Phase 2

### Daily Huddle viewer ✓ (v5.53–v6.95)

The daily Huddle PDF arrives by email and appears automatically in the `📋 Huddle` button in index.html.

- ✅ Manual upload via admin.html (Phase 1, v5.53)
- ✅ Automated upload via Power Automate → Cloud Function `ingestHuddle` (Phase 2, v5.66)
- ✅ Both PDF and DOCX file types supported (v6.95)
- ✅ Push notifications when a new Huddle arrives (v6.11, v6.61)

**Still to build:** History viewer in admin.html — a list of past Huddles by date with tap-to-open links. The `huddles` Firestore collection is already populated; query by date descending. Admin-only section (`CONFIG.ADMIN_NAMES.includes(currentUser)`). See CLAUDE.md → "Huddle ingest" for schema.

### Weekly Roster Upload ✓ (v5.77–v5.91)

Admin uploads the weekly PDF roster. Cloud Function `parseRosterPDF` passes the PDF to Claude AI, which reads the table and extracts each person's shifts. The app then shows a per-person review UI and saves only the approved changes.

**Key design decisions:**
- Direct PDF input to Claude rather than text extraction — pdf-parse destroys the table column structure; Claude reads the visual layout correctly
- `RDW|HH:MM-HH:MM` internal encoding — preserves the RDW flag through the review pipeline so RDW is identified correctly even on SPARE weeks
- `source: 'roster_import'` on saved overrides — distinguishes auto-applied from hand-entered; previous imports are always replaced cleanly by a new upload

See CLAUDE.md → "Weekly Roster Upload" for the full API and review pipeline.

### Payday calculator ✓ (v6.50–v7.07)

Staff enter their hours; the calculator computes estimated tax, NI, pension, and take-home pay per pay period. Lives at `paycalc.html` / `paycalc.js`, fully integrated into the main app.

**Key design decisions:**
- One service worker rather than per-page SWs — two SWs sharing the same scope competed and wiped each other's caches
- `pay-manifest.json` kept separate from `manifest.json` — allows independent home-screen installation with a distinct app name ("MYB Pay")
- Roster-aware fill bar (v7.07) — pre-fills Saturday/Sunday/BH counts from the base roster in one tap; works offline

The calculator is **not** a payslip replacement — estimates only. Actual payslips may differ.

### Huddle push notifications ✓ (v6.11)

Web Push notifications via Firebase Cloud Functions. When a new Huddle arrives, every subscribed device gets a push. Staff subscribe via the toggle in admin.html. VAPID keys live in Firebase Secret Manager.

**iOS note:** Requires Safari and the app installed to the Home Screen. Android Chrome works via the browser.

**Still to assess:** Notification reliability in real daily use. If iOS delivery proves unreliable, consider native app (see "Native app" below).

### Team Week View ✓ (v8.22–v8.40)

All logged-in staff can view the whole team's shifts for any week directly from the calendar page. Tap **👥 Team** to switch from the personal monthly calendar to a week grid — one row per person, one column per day (Sun–Sat, following the Chiltern working week convention).

- CEA, CES, and Dispatcher rosters are tab-selectable
- Firestore overrides are fetched and overlaid on the base roster in real time
- The 📋 Huddle button appears in the header so staff can open the day's briefing without leaving the view
- Week navigation: Prev / Next buttons; the Today button snaps back to the current week
- Shift cells are colour-coded identically to the personal calendar (☀️ early / 🌙 late / 🌃 night / 🏠 RD / 🏖️ AL / 💼 RDW etc.)
- Print-ready — the table prints cleanly on A4 landscape

**Key design decisions:**
- Sun–Sat week via `getSunday(date)` (Chiltern convention — not Mon–Sun)
- `fetchToken` pattern: rapid week navigation cancels stale Firestore results so the UI never shows data for the wrong week
- Grade-tabs row uses CSS grid (`1fr auto 1fr`) to keep the tab group centred regardless of how many utility buttons sit on the right
- Admin-only gate removed at v8.40 — the feature was admin-only (v8.22–v8.39) during development; all staff can now access it

## UX experiments — explored but held back

Ideas that were prototyped and reverted. Implementation notes preserved here so they can be restored quickly if the case for them changes.

### Bottom navigation bar
**Status:** Prototyped at v7.66, reverted — felt like clutter at current scale

A fixed tab bar at the bottom of the screen on mobile with three items:
📅 Roster · 💷 Pay · 🔐 Admin

The active tab would be highlighted in gold; all three pages would share the same bar via shared.css.

**Why it was held back:**
The app currently has three pages and the existing entry points (the Admin and Pay buttons in the controls row, the back arrow on inner pages) are sufficient for the current use pattern. Adding a persistent nav bar makes the screen feel busier without a clear navigational payoff at three pages.

**When to revisit:**
- If staff report not knowing how to get between the Calendar, Pay, and Admin pages
- If the controls row is simplified and loses the dedicated Pay/Admin buttons
- If a notice board or further page is added and navigation becomes genuinely confusing

**Note:** Team Week View (v8.22) is an in-page view within the calendar — it does not replace cross-page navigation between Calendar / Pay / Admin.

**Implementation notes (already written, can be restored):**
- CSS lives in shared.css — `.bottom-nav`, `.bottom-nav-item`, `.bottom-nav-icon`
- Each page needs `<nav class="bottom-nav">` before `</body>` with the active item marked
- Body needs `padding-bottom: calc(64px + env(safe-area-inset-bottom))` on mobile only
- Hidden on desktop (≥768px) via `display: none` in the base rule; shown via `@media (max-width: 767px)` block
- Print: `display: none !important` already in the media query

### Glanceable summary strip
**Status:** Prototyped at v7.66, reverted — adds clutter above the calendar

A horizontal scrolling row of four white pill chips below the controls, shown only when logged in:

| Chip | Source | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Today** | Base roster + override cache | Offline-first; shows type or start time |
| **Next RD** | Base roster scan (90 days) | Override cache applied where available |
| **Leave left** | Firestore (async) | Shows "…" until loaded; fires once per member |
| **Payday** | `getPaydaysAndCutoffs()` | Offline; shows date + days remaining |

**Why it was held back:**
On a phone the calendar itself is the primary information — the strip adds a layer of noise between the controls and the calendar grid. The same information is already reachable (AL via the 🏖️ AL button; payday from the pay period strip; today's shift from the calendar cell itself).

**When to revisit:**
- If staff on longer shifts want a "what am I doing today?" glance without scrolling to find today's cell
- If the pay period strip is removed (the strip was partly redundant with it)
- Consider putting it *inside* the controls card as a collapsed/expandable panel rather than between controls and calendar

**Implementation notes (already written, can be restored):**
- HTML: four `<div class="sc">` chips in `<div id="summaryStrip">` after `#payPeriodStrip`
- CSS: `.summary-strip` (flex, overflow-x: auto), `.sc`, `.sc-label`, `.sc-val`
- JS: `updateSummaryStrip()` in app.js — called from `renderCalendar()`
- The AL query is de-duplicated via `_summaryALFetched` flag, reset in `clearMemberCaches()`
- All data sources are already imported — no new dependencies needed

## Design audit — April 2026

A full design review was run against a generic 10-point modernisation list. The app turned out to be more mature than the generic advice implied. Recorded here so future audits don't re-tread the same ground.

**Already well-implemented (no action needed):**
- Shadows — `0 1px 4px` at 10% opacity (minimal by modern standards)
- Typography — 6-tier scale (`--type-micro` → `--type-xl`) applied throughout
- Motion — today-pulse, skeleton shimmer, spring lightbox, swipe transitions all exist
- Colour contrast — every shift colour audited and darkened to WCAG AA
- Touch target size, safe-area padding, reduced-motion — all handled

**Real gap identified — navigation.** Addressed (and held back) by the "Bottom navigation bar" experiment above.

**Not real problems for this app:**
- "Heavy cards / 2018 feel" — only an issue at very wide desktop viewports; v7.62 desktop layout changes already addressed this
- "Glanceable layouts" — a UX principle, not an actionable change

**Shipped from this audit:** Pay result hierarchy (v7.67) — the period line and hint text under the £ figure were too dim (72% / 48% opacity). Increased to 88% / 62% with slightly larger sizes for clearer hierarchy.

## Future capabilities — not committed, no fixed sequence

Each area is independent unless a dependency is noted.

### Operational visibility
**What:** Daily deployment view — who is working, spare, or on AL across the whole team for any given day. Useful for supervisors planning cover.

**Partially addressed:** Team Week View (v8.22) shows the whole team by week. A true daily view (single column for one date with a cover-status summary) would be a further step, but in practice the week view may be sufficient — supervisors can see the full week at a glance and identify gaps.

**Depends on:** Nothing new. All data already in Firestore.

**Worth doing if:** Supervisors find the week view insufficient for daily cover planning and want a more condensed single-day format.

### Approval workflows
**What:** Staff submit requests (shift swaps, overtime availability). Supervisor sees pending requests and approves or declines. Outcomes recorded in Firestore.

**Depends on:** Current auth model is sufficient for submitting requests. Supervisor UI needed.

**Decision point:** How much request volume is there? If the owner currently handles a small number of changes by direct conversation, formal workflows may add process without adding value.

### Notifications — approval/assignment events
**What:** Staff notified when a spare is assigned or a request is approved. Supervisor notified when requests arrive.

**Depends on:** Approval workflows (above). The Cloud Function infrastructure for push is already in place — extending it to cover other event types is a smaller lift now that the foundation exists.

### Formal AL management
**What:** Official AL request and approval workflow with entitlement tracking across the year.

**Depends on:** Approval workflows (above).

**Important caveat:** Chiltern Railways has an official HR system for leave management. Building a parallel approval process risks conflict between the two systems. This capability should remain clearly informational unless there is explicit agreement with management that the app's approval carries official weight.

### Calendar export
**What:** Staff shifts available in their phone calendar.

**Two routes — do the simpler one first:**

- **.ics file export** (simple): One-click download, staff import into any calendar app manually. Re-import needed when roster changes, but the base roster is stable. Build this first and assess whether demand for automatic sync is real.
- **Automatic calendar sync** (complex): Shifts pushed directly to Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or Outlook whenever the roster changes. Requires Firebase Cloud Functions and three separate calendar APIs. Microsoft Graph requires Chiltern IT involvement.

### Native app (conditional)
**Only pursue if one of these is true:**
- iOS push notification delivery is unacceptably unreliable in real use
- Chiltern IT require app store distribution via MDM
- PWA limitations are genuinely felt by users

**If pursued:** React Native. Same JavaScript language, Firebase carries over, only the UI layer needs rewriting. Requires Apple Developer account ($99/year) and Google Play ($25).

Do not build speculatively. The PWA works well for the current use case.

## Open decisions

**Auth hardening:** The surname password is practical for a roster app. If approval workflows or formal AL management are added, consider whether a colleague logging in as another person is an acceptable risk. Assess at the time. See CLAUDE.md → "Firebase Auth migration" for the migration plan.

**Multi-admin:** ✓ Resolved — `CONFIG.ADMIN_NAMES` is now an array in `roster-data.js`. Adding another admin is a one-line change (name must match `teamMembers[n].name` exactly).

**Official status:** Is this app sanctioned by Chiltern Railways? The more operationally critical it becomes, the more important this question is.

**GDPR:** Staff shift data is personal data. If the app becomes official infrastructure, data controller status and retention policies will need documenting.
