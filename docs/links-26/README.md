# Links — December 2026, 26 lines

**From 1 Oct 2026 the December 2026 link is 26 lines, not 24.** Everything drawn for 24 lines is kept, unchanged, in
`../links-24/`, both for reference and in case the 24-line link comes back. This folder is for the work from here on.

The 24-line work is not wasted. The rules, the duty tables, the tooling and the designs all carry over. What has to
change is the arithmetic that depends on the number of lines.

## The rules — settled 1 Oct 2026

**`RULES.md` is the rule set for 26 lines.** It is the 24-line set with the owner's changes marked in it: 26 lines;
**5 cover weeks**, as evenly spread as 26 allows (gaps of 5, 5, 5, 5 and 6); and **219 contracted days a year or
fewer**, today's figure as a ceiling. Everything else is unchanged, fourteen on a Saturday included (still a flexible
rule).

What that means in numbers: 21 working lines, so the contract is **44,100** Monday-to-Saturday minutes a week; and the
ceiling allows **at most 89 Monday-to-Saturday duties, averaging at least about 8h 16m** (89 gives 218.6 days a year,
90 would give 220.6). With fourteen on a Saturday, that is about 15 a weekday. The working is in `RULES.md`.

## What carries over unchanged

- **The rules, in their three tiers,** with the changes above: the 3 hard limits, the 9 December staffing rules
  and the 3 flexible rules. See `RULES.md`.
- **The shift-time sets** of the strongest 24-line designs, as starting points:
  - **Familiar Nine** (`../links-24/Familiar-Nine-F9-24-K31s.json`): every rule met, 14 of 20 weeks on one turn.
  - **Right Away** (`../links-24/Right-Away-FR-24-F34s.json`).
  - **Silva Lining** (`../links-24/Silva-Lining-SL-24-Hs.json`, version H of its series): 14 times, no fatigue warnings, a
    9-hour cap.
- **The judging.** Every figure comes from the app's own Links modules, which take the line count as a parameter.

## The tooling (`tooling/`, set up 1 Oct 2026)

The 24-line pipeline, copied and set to 26 lines. **`tooling/link.mjs` states the link once**: 26 lines, 5 cover weeks
(default lines 1, 6, 11, 16, 21), 21 working lines, the 44,100-minute contract, the 219-day ceiling, and the headcounts the
tables are built to (15 a weekday, 14 on a Saturday, 10 on a Sunday). Every script reads those from there; none writes
the number down. The 24-line tooling stays untouched in `../links-24/tooling/`, so that pack can still be rebuilt exactly.

**What it checks, beyond the 24-line set** (`RULES.md`):
- **Cover weeks:** five, with gaps differing by one line at most (`coverSpread`). It is a flexible rule, as before.
- **The days ceiling is a HARD limit.** `assess()` (`report-data.mjs`) adds it to the hard-limit checks, so a design
  over 219 contracted days a year "cannot be run as it stands" on page 1. On page 6 it shares the contract card:
  "35h a week · 218.6 contracted days a year, 219 at most".
- **No waivers and no named offices** are carried over from 24 lines (`fresh.mjs`, `report-data.mjs`).

**The scripts kept** are the ones the Familiar Nine / Right Away method uses. The one-off searches for particular
24-line designs stay in `links-24` only.

| Stage | Script | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 · duty table | `final-table.mjs` | the best table for one day, by fit to the trains, under every rule; a proof unless `ANNEAL=1` |
| | `assemble-table.mjs` | three days' tables into one duty table (weekday · Saturday · Sunday) |
| 2 · rota | `anneal.mjs` | arranges a table on the 26 lines; `TABLE=<table.json>`, `MODE=rules` for fatigue first |
| | `carry-order.mjs` | lays a table onto an existing rota's week structure (how Familiar Nine borrowed Right Away's) |
| | `rota-polish.mjs`, `order-polish.mjs` | reorder only (same-day and whole-line swaps), never worse than a reference |
| 3 · sheets | `supplied.mjs` via `regenerate.mjs` | the eight-page sheet for a grid; add the design to `SUPPLIED` |
| | `rules-sheet.mjs`, `summary-sheet.mjs` | the rules reference (`../December-2026-Rules.pdf`) and the one-page summary |

**Proven working end to end on 1 Oct 2026** with a throwaway table (not a proposal), using Familiar Nine's settings:
- **Duty table:** a weekday of 15 duties and 7,440 minutes, proven; a Saturday of 14 at 6,900, proven, every time
  already worked today; a Sunday of 10. Together that is 44,100 Monday-to-Saturday minutes over 89 duties, exactly the
  contract at the 219-day ceiling (218.6).
- **Rota and sheet:** being checked next. The rota search runs on that table, and a sheet will be rendered from the result.

**Commands** (from `tooling/`; the `H=` settings are Familiar Nine's office handling — see `../links-24/README.md`):

```

env $H HI=540 TODAY=1 NEWPEN=2 AT22_STRICT=1 CLS=weekday MAX_TURNS=8 ANNEAL=1 OUT=wk.json node final-table.mjs
env $H HI=540 TODAY=1 NEWPEN=2 AT22_STRICT=1 CLS=sat MAX_TURNS=6 OUT=sat.json node final-table.mjs     # TOTAL=6900 by default

node supplied.mjs <grid.json> "<Name>" "<strap>" <XX-26-CODE>       # or list it in regenerate.mjs's SUPPLIED
node rules-sheet.mjs
```

**The split between weekdays and Saturday is a choice.** Five weekdays and a Saturday must make 44,100 minutes. The
default is 7,440 a weekday and 6,900 on a Saturday; sweep it with `TOTAL=` as the 24-line work did. ANNEAL=1 found no
Saturday at 6,900; the exhaustive search (the default) did, in 92 seconds.

**Still 24 in the app.** `ROTATING_LINES = 24` in `links-design.js` is the Links page's own line count. It moves to 26 as
its own app release (owner, 1 Oct 2026). Until then the tooling passes 26 to every app function explicitly, and the
Links page itself still lays out 24 lines.
